/*Create a function template called search that accepts four arguments in any order you prefer:

    A reference to a Collection of templated objects (template type 1). 
    The Collection is defined in Collection.h
    An array of templated objects; the same type as the Collection type. (template type 1)
    Number of elements in the array of objects
    A key templated value to search for, in the array of objects. (template type 2)

The search function template returns a bool that is true only if at least one match to the key
is found in the array of objects and false otherwise.

The search function goes through all the elements of the array of objects and adds all the matches 
found to the Collection. (use the "==" operator to check for a match between the objects and the key)*/
