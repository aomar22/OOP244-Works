Learning Objectives:

    define and create copy constructors
    define and create copy assignment
    Prevent copying and assignment in a class
    Overload insertion operator so the class can be printed using ostream
    Overload extraction operator so the class can be read using istream
    Do simple file IO using ifstream and ofstream
    use the C++ string class to extract an unknown number of characters from the input.

Workshop 6 was rich of new concepts for me. As we used to use fundamental attributes, which have known memory size according to their type, this time we are using an attribute that is a pointer that hold the address of dynamic array of Line class. For example, Line* m_textLines; is called a dynamic resource that points to array of lines allocated dynamically.

To safely manage allocating and deallocating dynamic memories and apply deep copying safely, we follow the rules of three as follows:

1- Create a copy constructor: e.g. TextFile(const TextFile& file);
Copy constructor is a special function that does the following:
	a- shallow copy non dynamic resources. e.g. this->m_pageSize = file.m_pageSize; shallow copying to m_pageSize attribute

	b- Allocate memory for each new resource. e.g. setFilename(file.m_filename, true); "This function contains of allocating memory for m_filename to deep copy the filename. && the same with loadText() function which allocates memory for m_textLines.

	c- Copy data from the source resource to the newly allocated source. e.g. strcpy(m_filename, filename) && m_textLines[countLines] = line.c_str().

the declaration of the copy constructor takes the form: Type(const Type&);  e.g. TextFile(const TextFile& file);

2- Copy assignment:
The second of the rule of 3 is copy assignement which its declaration takes the form: Type& operator=(const Type&);
e.g. TextFile& operator=(const TextFile& file);
This special function copies an existing object to another existing object throught the following steps:
 	a- check for self assignment: e.g.   if(this != &file)
	b- deallocates previously allocated memory for resources associated with the current object: e.g. delete[] m_textLines;

3- Destructor: to deallocate dynamically created memory
_____________________________________
To prevent copying and assignment in the class, we declare the functions in the class and use delete keywords. E.g. TextFile(const TextFile&)=delete;
TextFile& operator=(const TextFile& file) = delete;
* we don't implement the function or write any definition.
----------------------------------------------
Overload insertion operator so the class can be printed using ostream
    Overload extraction operator so the class can be read using istream
by changing the operator function signature to overload it using ostream, the class can be printed or read.
E.g. of overload insertion operator: 
 std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& ostr, const TextFile& text);
when printing, text.view(ostr)

e.g. of overload extractio operator
std::istream& operator>>(std::istream& istr, TextFile& text)
to read the file  text.getFile(istr);
----------------------------------------------------------------

 Do simple file IO using ifstream and ofstream
example: std::ostream& view(std::ostream& ostr)const;
ostr << name() << endl;  like when we use cout
std::istream& getFile(std::istream& istr);
can be used as getline(istr, s);
-----------------------------

    use the C++ string class to extract an unknown number of characters from the input.

example in the loadText function:
 string line;

 if (fin) { 
     while (getline(fin, line)) {  //In a loop reads each line into the string object
         m_textLines[countLines].m_value = new char[line.length() + 1]; 
         m_textLines[countLines] = line.c_str(); 

and the getFile function:
std::istream& TextFile::getFile(std::istream& istr) {
    string s;
    getline(istr, s);
    m_filename = new char[s.length() + 1];
    strcpy(m_filename, s.c_str());
  //  setFilename(m_filename);
    setNoOfLines();
    loadText();
    
    return istr;
}
