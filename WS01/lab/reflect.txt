Amany Omar, aomar22@myseneca.ca, 126 127 166, Completed on May 14th.
I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

- Working with modules was kind of straight forward. However, the only challenge in this workshop was my confusion about where should I use namespace seneca in the code. Since there are multiple files, it was challenging to figure out which code and which file to use namespace seneca.

What I learnt:
- using namespaces and that they can  be stated in header files or in source code file according to its use.
- namespace can group variables and functions in the source file and group the prototypes in the header file.
- Organizing modules and grouping each group of functions that is related to a specific task.
- separately compiling each module.
