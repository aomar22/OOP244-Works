Amany Omar, aomar22@myseneca.ca, 126 127 166, Completed on May 14th.
I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

-I tried avoiding including header file in another header file, but the program didn't work until I included ShoppingRec.h header file in File.h header file, because it was needed.

What I learned:
- using namespaces and that they can  be stated in header files or in source code file according to its use. e.g. I used namespace Seneca in both File.cpp and File.h
- namespace can group variables and functions in the source file and group the prototypes in the header file.
- Organizing modules and grouping each group of functions that is related to a specific task, e.g. implementations goes into the source code files, structure declaration, constant variables according to where they are needed..
- separately compiling each module, e.g. File.cpp and File.h by using right click on the source code file and select compile.
- Should not include a header file in another header file Unless it is necessary.
